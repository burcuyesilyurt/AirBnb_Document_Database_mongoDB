To improve the performance and accuracy of the AirBNB database, I have proposed several schema changes, indexing strategies, and data-cleaning methods. These modifications aim to enhance query speed, data integrity, and overall system efficiency, addressing the issues highlighted by the previous Data Modelling department.
